**Flashing Instructions for Marble: By KSSRAO**

**Before start flashing.....**

- Always have backup of your internal storage
- Use TWRP recovery meant for Android 14. Check the note [**#twrp_a14**](https://t.me/KSSRAO_Romverse)
- To retain TWRP recovery after rom flash, don't forget to tick the option "Automatically Reflash TWRP after flashing a rom" in recovery. Else TWRP will be replaced by recovery from rom
- For Kernel SU, check note [**#ksu_a14**](https://t.me/KSSRAO_Romverse)
- For vanilla variant, if u need gapps, [**Nikgapps is Recommended**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nikgapps/files/Releases/NikGapps-U/)
